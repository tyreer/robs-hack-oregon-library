## Robert's rendition of Hack Oregon's React Component Library
---
This repository takes Hack Oregon’s component library and strips out all the components that I did not personally author. The two components here showcase a few of my individual contributions to Hack Oregon’s cross-team component library—a donut chart made with ReCharts and a Leaflet map overlaid with GeoJSON data.

You can find the official Hack Oregon Component Library [here](https://github.com/hackoregon/component-library)
The launch of this year's projects will take place May 1st in Portland, Oregon. Find more info about Hack Oregon [here](http://www.hackoregon.org/).
